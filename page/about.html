<h1>Four years for Forty Acres</h1> 
	
<p>
Five months ago, I promised to the Class of 2018 to commence a four year project to transform
the Forty Acres. The goal: reform financial aid policy, reconnect students (especially 
freshman) with Student Government, and reinforcing UT's status as America's "Public Ivy 
League."
</p>
<p>
In five months, I became familiar with the power and limits of Student Government. I 
investigated Student Governments across the country for ideas on how to better connect with 
and serve students. In the process, I created a campus-wide network of freshman who share
my passion for transforming our campus.
</p>
<p><strong>
To the Class of 2015, 2016, and 2017, I ask you to partner with me. Let's transform these 
Forty Acres.
