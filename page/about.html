			<h1>Four years for Forty Acres</h1> 
			
			<p>
				Five months ago, I promised to the Class of 2018 to commence a four year project to transform
				the Forty Acres. The goal: reform financial aid policy, reconnect students (especially 
				freshman) with Student Government, and reinforcing UT's status as America's "Public Ivy 
				League."
			</p>
			<p>
				In five months, I became familiar with the power and limits of Student Government. I 
				investigated Student Governments across the country for ideas on how to better connect with 
				and serve students. In the process, I created a campus-wide network of freshman who share
				my passion for transforming our campus.
			</p>
			<p><strong>
				To the Class of 2015, 2016, and 2017, I ask you to partner with me. Let's transform these 
				Forty Acres.
